 <H1>Headache</H1>
 <BR>
  <H3>Overview</H3>
A headache is pain or discomfort in the head or face. Headaches vary greatly in terms of the <br>
location and intensity of the pain, and how often the headaches occur.<br>
The brain tissue doesn’t have pain-sensitive nerve fibers and doesn’t feel pain. <br>
But, other parts of the head can be responsible for a headache including:<br>
<br>
<ul=circles>

<li>A network of nerves that extends over the scalp</li>
<br>
<li>Certain nerves in the face, mouth, and throat</lli>
<br>
<li>Muscles of the head, neck, and shoulders</li>
<br>
<li>Blood vessels found along the surface and at the base of the brain</li>
<br></ul>

<h3>Different types of headaches include:</h3>

<br>
 <h4>Migraine</H4>
  In this type of headache, symptoms other than pain occur as part of the headache. Nausea and vomiting, lightheadedness, <br>
 sensitivity to light (photophobia), and other visual symptoms typically occur with migraines. Migraines also have distinct phases. <br>
 Not all people have each phase, however.
   <h4>The phases of a migraine headache may include:</h4>
 <ul=squares>
<li>Premonition or prodromal phase - A change in mood or behavior may occur hours or days before the headache.</li>
<br><li>Aura phase - A group of visual, sensory, or motor symptoms can precede the headache. Examples include vision <br>changes, hallucinations, numbness, changes in speech, and muscle weakness.</li>
<br><li>Headache phase - Period during the actual headache with throbbing pain on one or both sides of the head. <br>Sensitivity to light and motion are common, as are depression, fatigue, and axiety.</li>
<br><li>Resolution phase - Pain lessens during this phase, but may be replaced with fatigue, irritability, and trouble <br>concentrating. Some people feel refreshed after an attack, others do not.</li>
 </ul>

<br>
 <h4>Tension headaches</h4>
<br>

Tension headaches are the most common type of headache. Stress and tight muscles are often factors in tension-type headaches.
<h4>These are common symptoms of a tension-type headache:</h4>

<ul=squares>
<li>Slow onset of the headache</li>
<br>
<li>Head usually hurts on both sides</li>
<br>
<li>Pain is dull or feels like a band or vice around the head</li>
<br>
<li>Pain may involve the back part of the head or neck</li>
<br>
<li>Pain is mild to moderate, but not severe</li>
<br>
<li>Tension type headaches typically do not cause nausea, vomiting, or sensitivity to light (photophobia).</li>
<br></ul>


<br>
<h4>Cluster headaches</h4>
Cluster headaches usually occur in a series that may last weeks or months.

<h4>These are the most common symptoms of a cluster headache:</h4>
<ul=squares>
<li>Severe pain on one side of the head, usually behind one eye</li>
<br>
<li>The eye that is affected may be red and watery with a droopy lid and small pupil</li>
<br>
<li>Swelling of the eyelid</li>
<br>
<li>Runny nose or congestion</li>
<br>
<li>Swelling of the forehead</li>
<br>
</ul>
<h3>What causes a headache?</h3>
<br>
Headaches are classified as primary or secondary.
<h4>A primary headache</h4> - means the headache itself is the main medical problem, although other factors, <br>such as muscle tension or exposure to certain foods, may be identified. Other contributing factors include medicines, dehydration, or hormone changes.<br>

<h4>A secondary headache</h4> - is related to an underlying medical condition. An example of this would be a headache <br>due to neck injury, eye problems, jaw, teeth or sinus infection. 
<br>

<br>
<h4>What are the symptoms of a headache?</h4>
Headache symptoms depend on the type of headache. The frequency of headaches and the intensity of the symptoms may vary, too. <br>Typical headache symptoms include:<br>

<li>Pain may involve the back part of the head or neck</li>
<br>
<li>Pain is mild to moderate, but not severe</li>
<br>

The symptoms of a headache may look like other conditions or medical problems. Always see your healthcare provider for a diagnosis.

<br>
<h4>How is a headache diagnosed?</h4>
