    <p><h4> CPR, or cardiopulmonary resuscitation can help save a life during cardiac arrest, when the heart stops beating or beats too ineffectively to circulate blood to the brain and other vital organs. However, even after training, remembering the CPR steps and administering them correctly can be a challenge. To be prepared when moments matter, please read the steps below.

<h1> Adult CPR </h1>
<br>


<h2>1</h2>
CHECK the scene for safety, form an initial impression and use personal protective equipment (PPE)

<h2>2</h2>
If the person appears unresponsive, CHECK for responsiveness, breathing, life-threatening bleeding or other life-threatening conditions using shout-tap-shout

<h2>3</h2>
If the person does not respond and is not breathing or only gasping, CALL 9-1-1 and get equipment, or tell someone to do so

<h2>4</h2>
Kneel beside the person. Place the person on their back on a firm, flat surface

<h2>5</h2>
Give 30 chest compressions

Hand position: Two hands centered on the chest
Body position: Shoulders directly over hands; elbows locked
Depth: At least 2 inches
Rate: 100 to 120 per minute
Allow chest to return to normal position after each compression

<h2>6</h2>
Give 2 breaths

Open the airway to a past-neutral position using the head-tilt/chin-lift technique
Pinch the nose shut, take a normal breath, and make complete seal over the person’s mouth with your mouth.
Ensure each breath lasts about 1 second and makes the chest rise; allow air to exit before giving the next breath
Note: If the 1st breath does not cause the chest to rise, retilt the head and ensure a proper seal before giving the 2nd breath If the 2nd breath does not make the chest rise, an object may be blocking the airway

<h2>7</h2>
Continue giving sets of 30 chest compressions and 2 breaths. Use an AED as soon as one is available! Minimize interruptions to chest compressions to less than 10 seconds.

<h1> Baby and/or Child CPR </h1>


<h3>Call 911</h3>
<p>If you’re alone with a child or baby who is unresponsive and not breathing (or only gasping), call 911 after you’ve done 2 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).
If someone else is present, shout for the person to call 911 and then have them locate an AED (a defibrillator) right away while you begin CPR.
If a child or baby is unconscious but you see regular breathing, call 911 and wait for help. A breathing child or baby does not need CPR, but one that is not breathing or gasping does.
For adult CPR, see Hands-Only CPR for Adults.</p>

This article is a guideline. It is important to learn CPR to know how to do it correctly. For more information about a CPR course, go to redcross.org or heart.org.

<h2> Step 1 </h2> :Check to see if the child is conscious
Make sure you and the child are in safe surroundings.
Tap the child gently.
Shout, “Are you OK?"
Look quickly to see if the child has any injuries, bleeding, or medical problems.

<h2> Step 2</h2> :Check breathing
Place your ear near the child’s mouth and nose. Is there breath on your cheek? Is the child’s chest moving?

<h2>Step 3</h2> :Begin chest compressions
If the child doesn’t respond and isn’t breathing:

<p>Carefully place the child on their back. For a baby, be careful not to tilt the head back too far. If you suspect a neck or head injury, roll the baby over, moving their entire body at once.
For a baby, place two fingers on breastbone. For a child, place heel of one hand on center of chest at nipple line. You also can push with one hand on top of the other.
For a child, press down about 2 inches. Make sure not to press on ribs, as they are fragile and prone to fracture.
For a baby, press down about 1 1/2 inches, about 1/3 to 1/2 the depth of chest. Make sure not to press on the end of the breastbone.
Do 30 chest compressions, at the rate of 100 per minute. Let the chest rise completely between pushes.
Check to see if the child has started breathing. Continue CPR until help arrives.</p>

<h2> Step 4</h2> :Do rescue breathing
To open the airway, lift the child’s chin up with one hand. At the same time, tilt the head back by pushing down on the forehead with the other hand. Do not tilt the head back if the child is suspected of having a neck or head injury.
For a child, cover their mouth tightly with yours. Pinch the nose closed and give breaths.
For a baby, cover the mouth and nose with your mouth and give breaths.
Give the child two breaths, watching for the chest to rise each time. Each breath should take one second.

<h2>Step 5</h2> :Repeat compressions and rescue breathing if the child is still not breathing
Two breaths can be given after every 30 chest compressions. If someone else is helping you, you should give 15 compressions, then 2 breaths.
Continue this cycle of 30 compressions and 2 breaths until the child starts breathing or emergency help arrives.
If you are alone with the child and have done 2 minutes of CPR (about 5 cycles of compressions and breathing), call 911 and find an AED.

<h2>Step 6</h2> :Use an AED as soon as one is available
For children age 9 and under, use a pediatric automated external defibrillator (AED), if available. If a pediatric AED is not available, or for children age 1 and older, use a standard AED.

Turn on the AED.
Wipe the chest dry and attach the pads.
The AED will give you step-by-step instructions.
Continue compressions and follow AED prompts until emergency help arrives or the child starts breathing.
